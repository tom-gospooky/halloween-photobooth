# Google AI (Gemini) API - includes Veo 3 video generation and image generation
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

**Configuration Details:**
- `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH`: Path to your downloaded JSON credentials file
- `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID`: The root folder ID created by the setup script (automatically filled)
- `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY`: Your Gemini API key from Google AI Studio

4. **Start the server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. **Test your setup:**
```bash

### Quick Configuration Checklist

‚úÖ **Before running the system, verify:**

1. **Files exist:**
   - `./credentials/service-account.json` (downloaded from Google Cloud)
   - `.env` file (copied from `.env.example`)

2. **Google Cloud setup:**
   - Google Drive API is enabled in your project
   - Service account has "Editor" role
   - Service account JSON key is downloaded

3. **Environment variables:**
   ```bash
   # Check your .env file contains:
   GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH=./credentials/service-account.json
   GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=1abc123def456... # (from setup script)
   GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=AIzaSy... # (from Google AI Studio)
   ```

4. **Folder structure:**
   - Run `npm run setup` to create Google Drive folders
   - **Location:** Folders are created in the **root directory** of your Google Drive (not in any subfolder)
   - **Folder name:** You'll be prompted to name it (default: "Halloween-Photobooth-2025")
   - **What you'll see:** A new folder appears at the top level of your Google Drive with 4 subfolders inside
   - Note the root folder ID provided by setup script

## üìÅ Google Drive Structure

**Where folders are created:**
The setup script creates a new folder **in the root of your Google Drive** (at the same level as other folders you might have). 

**Folder structure created:**
```
Your Google Drive Root/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Halloween-Photobooth-2025/          # üìÅ Root folder (you name this)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ input/                           # üì∏ Photographer uploads photos here
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ output/                          # üé¨ Generated videos appear here  
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ screensaver/                     # üì∫ Fallback videos for continuous playback
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ archive/                         # üì¶ Long-term storage of all content
```

**What you'll see in Google Drive:**
1. Open [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) in your browser
2. Look for "Halloween-Photobooth-2025" (or your chosen name) at the top level
3. Click into it to see the 4 subfolders: input, output, screensaver, archive
4. The folder ID in your `.env` file refers to this root "Halloween-Photobooth-2025" folder

### Access:
- **Your Google Account:** Full access to all folders (owner)
- **Service Account:** API access for automation  
- **Party Guests:** No direct access (view videos on big screen only)

**Note:** Since you have full Google Drive access, you can upload photos directly to the `input/` folder or any other folder as needed.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **"Google Drive access failed"**
   - **Service Account Issues:**
     - Verify `./credentials/service-account.json` exists and is valid JSON
     - Ensure service account has "Editor" role in Google Cloud
     - Check that Google Drive API is enabled in your project
   - **Folder ID Issues:**
     - Run `npm run setup` to create folder structure and get correct ID
     - **Manually verify:** Go to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) and look for your Halloween folder in the **root directory** (not in any subfolder)
     - The folder should contain 4 subfolders: input, output, screensaver, archive
     - Ensure service account has access to the folder
     - **Wrong ID?** The ID should be a long string like `1BxiMVs0XRA5nFMdKvBdBZjgmUUqptlbs74OgvE2upms`
   - **Permissions:**
     - Service account email should have access to the Drive folder
     - Check folder sharing settings in Google Drive

2. **"No videos generating"**
   - Check Gemini API key and quota
   - Verify all Gemini models are enabled (vision, image generation, Veo 3)
   - Look for photos in input folder
   - Check for content filter blocks in logs

3. **"Images not enhancing"**
   - Gemini Native Image may not be available in your region
   - System will automatically use original images
   - Check API quotas and model availability

4. **"Player shows loading forever"**  
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify server is running on port 3000
   - Clear browser cache and refresh

5. **"Only screensaver videos playing"**
   - Check API service health at `/api/status`
   - Verify new photos are in input folder
   - Review server logs for Gemini API errors
   - Check if Veo 3 is available in your region

### System Health
Monitor via `/api/status`:
```json
{
  "status": "running",
  "services": {
    "googleDrive": true,
    "fileWatcher": true
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-31T23:59:59.999Z"
}
```

## üìû Support

- **Setup Issues:** Run `npm run setup` again
- **API Problems:** Check service account permissions
- **Performance:** Monitor system resources during event
- **Customization:** Edit prompt templates in `src/utils/promptTemplates.js`
